# AI Interaction Log
This document logs interactions with AI models, capturing prompts and responses for reference and analysis.

### Point3D
Generation Prompt: "Would you generate a class in Java that represents a point in 3D space.
Include methods for distance, as well as rotation and any other methods that make sense for a 3D point.
Include comments for each method in the style of Spring Framework getting started guides explaining each method in detail.
Also include a logger utilizing the Java util logging framework.  Use log lines to print information and errors
in each method that make sense for the method context.  For now, just utilize the INFO, WARNING and SEVERE log levels.
Document the object-oriented design patterns used in the class and explain how they demonstrate
foundational principles for data structures and algorithms."

### Line 3D
Generation Prompt: "Would you generate a class in Java that represents a line in 3D space.
Utilize the Point3D class we created earlier as necessary. Include methods for line length,
as well as a shortest distance between lines method and any other methods that make sense for a 3D line.
Include comments for each method in the style of Spring Framework getting started guides explaining each method in detail.
Also include a logger utilizing the Java util logging framework. Use log lines to print information and errors
in each method that make sense for the method context. For now, just utilize the INFO, WARNING and SEVERE log levels.
Document the object-oriented design patterns used in the class and explain how they demonstrate
foundational principles for data structures and algorithms."

### Cube3D
Generation Prompt: "Would you generate a class in Java that represents a cube in 3D space.
Utilize the Point3D class as well as the Line3D class we created earlier as necessary.
Include methods for cube rotation, translation and perimeter length as well as volume
and any other methods that make sense for a 3D cube that may be used in a 3D graphics program.
Include comments for each method in the style of Spring Framework getting started guides explaining each method in detail.
Also include a logger utilizing the Java util logging framework. Use log lines to print information and errors
in each method that make sense for the method context. For now, just utilize the INFO, WARNING and SEVERE log levels.
Document the object-oriented design patterns used in the class and explain how they demonstrate
foundational principles for data structures and algorithms."
