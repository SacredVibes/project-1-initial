This document answers questions about the concepts taugt in module 1.

## Question 1
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It's a structured approach that defines the complete process of software development from initial concept to final deployment and maintenance.
The typical phases of the SDLC include:
* Planning - This initial phase involves defining project scope, identifying requirements, estimating resources, creating timelines, and assessing feasibility. Teams determine what needs to be built and how to approach the project.
* Requirements Analysis - During this phase, detailed functional and non-functional requirements are gathered from stakeholders. This includes understanding user needs, system specifications, and constraints that will guide the development process.
* Design - The system architecture and detailed design are created based on the requirements. This includes database design, user interface mockups, system architecture diagrams, and technical specifications that developers will follow.
* Implementation (Development) - The actual coding takes place during this phase. Developers write the software code according to the design specifications and coding standards established for the project.
* Testing - The software undergoes various types of testing including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing. Bugs are identified and fixed to ensure the software meets quality standards.
* Deployment - The tested software is released to the production environment where end users can access it. This may involve installation, configuration, and user training.
* Maintenance - After deployment, ongoing support includes bug fixes, updates, enhancements, and performance monitoring to keep the software running effectively over time.

Different SDLC methodologies like Waterfall, Agile, or DevOps may organize these phases differently, but these core activities are fundamental to most software development processes.

## Question 2
The software is tested for bugs and issues primarily during the Testing phase of the SDLC. This is a dedicated phase that occurs after the implementation/development phase and before deployment.

### How the Testing Phase Ensures Quality
The Testing phase ensures quality through multiple layers of systematic verification:

### Types of Testing Performed:
* Unit Testing - Individual components or modules are tested in isolation to verify they function correctly
* Integration Testing - Tests how different modules work together when combined
* System Testing - Validates the complete integrated system against the specified requirements
* User Acceptance Testing (UAT) - End users test the software to ensure it meets their needs and expectations
* Performance Testing - Evaluates how the system performs under various load conditions
* Security Testing - Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures data protection measures work properly

## Question 3

The Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is a systematic process that defines the testing activities performed during software development. It's a subset of the SDLC that focuses specifically on the testing aspect, providing a structured approach to ensure comprehensive testing coverage.

## Question 4
The Test Planning and Control phase is the foundational phase of the STLC where the overall testing strategy and approach are established. Here are the key activities performed during this phase:
### Test Planning Activities
* Scope Definition - Determine what will be tested (in-scope) and what will not be tested (out-of-scope). This includes identifying specific features, modules, and functionalities to be covered.
* Test Strategy Development - Define the overall approach to testing, including testing levels (unit, integration, system, acceptance), testing types (functional, performance, security), and methodologies to be used.
* Resource Planning - Identify and allocate human resources, including test team members, their roles and responsibilities. Plan for required skills and training needs.
* Test Environment Requirements - Specify the hardware, software, network configurations, and infrastructure needed for testing activities.
* Risk Assessment and Mitigation - Identify potential risks that could impact testing (technical risks, resource constraints, timeline pressures) and develop mitigation strategies.
* Entry and Exit Criteria - Define clear conditions for when testing can begin (entry criteria) and when it can be considered complete (exit criteria) for each testing phase.
* Test Estimation - Estimate the effort, time, and cost required for testing activities based on project scope and complexity.
* Test Documentation Standards - Establish templates and standards for test cases, test scripts, defect reports, and other testing artifacts.
### Test Control Activities
* Progress Monitoring - Track testing progress against planned timelines and milestones. Monitor test execution rates, defect discovery rates, and resource utilization.
* Quality Metrics Definition - Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics to measure testing effectiveness, such as test coverage, defect density, and test execution status.
* Schedule Management - Create detailed testing schedules and ensure alignment with overall project timelines. Adjust plans as needed based on project changes.
* Communication Planning - Define reporting structures, meeting schedules, and communication channels between testing team and other stakeholders.
* Tool Selection and Setup - Identify and procure necessary testing tools for test management, automation, performance testing, and defect tracking.
* Deliverables Planning - Define what testing deliverables will be produced (test plans, test cases, test reports) and their review and approval processes.

These activities ensure that testing is well-organized, properly resourced, and aligned with project objectives before actual test execution begins.

## Question 5
* An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions or rules designed to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task. It's a finite sequence of well-defined, unambiguous operations that takes input, processes it through logical steps, and produces a desired output.
* Think of an algorithm like a recipe - it provides clear, ordered instructions that can be followed to achieve a consistent result every time.

## Question 6
I'll provide a simple example using the Linear Search Algorithm, which solves the problem of finding a specific item in a list.
### Problem Statement
You have a list of numbers: [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3] and you want to find if the number 8 exists in this list and determine its position.
### Linear Search Algorithm Steps
1. Start at the beginning

Set a counter (index) to 0 to track your current position
Define the target value you're searching for (8 in this case)

2. Compare current element

Look at the element at the current index position
Compare it with the target value

3. Check if found

If the current element equals the target value, return the index position (you found it!)
If not, continue to the next step

4. Move to next element

Increase the index counter by 1
Move to the next element in the list

5. Repeat or finish

If you haven't reached the end of the list, go back to Step 2
If you've checked all elements without finding the target, return "not found"

## Question 7
UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standardized visual modeling language used in software engineering to specify, visualize, construct, and document software systems. It provides a common notation and set of diagrams that help developers, analysts, and stakeholders communicate about system design and architecture.

## Question 8
1. Class Diagrams
   Purpose: Class diagrams provide a blueprint for the code structure by showing the classes that need to be implemented, their attributes (data fields), methods (functions), and the relationships between different classes.
   Class diagrams help developers understand:

* What classes to create and their internal structure
* How classes inherit from or depend on other classes
* The data types and visibility (public, private, protected) of attributes and methods
* Associations, aggregations, and compositions between classes

This diagram type directly translates to code structure, making it invaluable during the design and implementation phases.
2. Sequence Diagrams
   Purpose: Sequence diagrams show how objects interact with each other over time by illustrating the sequence of messages (method calls) exchanged between different objects to accomplish a specific task or use case.
   Sequence diagrams help developers understand:

* The order in which methods should be called
* Which objects are responsible for specific operations
* How data flows between different components
* The lifecycle of objects during a particular interaction

This diagram type is particularly useful for implementing complex features that involve multiple classes working together, as it shows the step-by-step communication needed to achieve the desired functionality.
Both diagrams serve as essential communication tools between team members and provide clear guidance for translating design concepts into working code.
